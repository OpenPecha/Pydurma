## Project description

Pydurma creates a clean e-text version of a Tibetan work from multiple flawed sources.

Benefits include:

- Automatic proofreading of Tibetan e-texts
- Creating high-quality e-texts from low-quality sources
- Doesn't require a spell checker (which doesn't exist yet for Tibetan language)

Pydurma uses a weighted majority algorithm that compares versions of the work syllable-by-syllable and chooses the most common character from among the versions in each position of the text. Since mistakes—whether made during the woodblock carving, hand copying, digital text inputting, or OCRing process—are unlikely to be the same in the majority of the versions, they are unlikely to outrank the correct characters in any given position of the text. The result is a new clean version called a "vulgate edition."

### Uncritical editions or vulgates

**vulgate** (noun) /ˈvəl-ˌgāt/ or /ˈvʌlɡeɪt/: *2. a commonly accepted text or reading.*

Medieval Latin *vulgata*, from Late Latin *vulgata editio*: edition in general circulation.

“Vulgate.” Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulgate. Accessed 23 Dec. 2022.

This less common sense of the term *vulgate* represents the objective of this project.

## Who this project is for

This project is intended for:

- Publishers who need clean copies of texts to publish books
- Developers who need clean data to train AI models
- Anyone who needs to proofread a Tibetan text and has access to multiple versions, such as in the [BDRC library](https://library.bdrc.io).

## Dependencies

Before you start, ensure you've installed:

- python >= 3.7
- [openpecha](https://github.com/OpenPecha/Toolkit)
- regex
- fast-diff-match-patch

## Requirements 

To create a vulgate edition, you'll need:

- A reference pecha in the [OPF format](https://openpecha.org/data/opf-format/)
- Several witness pechas in the OPF format (a witness is a version of a text)

> **Note** To convert files into the OPF format, use [OpenPecha Tools](https://github.com/OpenPecha/Toolkit). 
> 
> You can also convert scanned texts in the [BDRC library](https://library.bdrc.io) to the OPF format with the [OCR Pipeline](https://tools.openpecha.org/ocr/).
> 
> To test Pydurma, you can also use the OPF files in the [text folder](https://github.com/OpenPecha/fast-collation-tools/tree/main/tests) in this repo.

## Instructions for use

### Configure Pydurma

Assuming you've installed the software above and have OPF files:

1. Clone this repo.
1. Add witnesses in the OPF format into your cloned repo.
1. Open `vulgatizer_op_ocr.py` in a code editor.
1. Update the paths to the actual witness folders in this code block:

```
def test_merger():
	op_output = OpenPechaFS("ITEST.opf")
	vulgatizer = VulgatizerOPTibOCR(op_output)
	vulgatizer.add_op_witness(OpenPechaFS("./test/opfs/I001/I001.opf"))
	vulgatizer.add_op_witness(OpenPechaFS("./test/opfs/I002/I002.opf"))
	vulgatizer.add_op_witness(OpenPechaFS("./test/opfs/I003/I003.opf"))
	vulgatizer.create_vulgate()
```

### Run Pydurma

- Run `vulgatizer_op_ocr.py`

The vulgate edition OPF will be saved in `./data/opfs/generic_editions`.

### Limitations

- No code to detect [transpositions](http://multiversiondocs.blogspot.com/2008/10/transpositions.html).

## Pydurma workflow

Pydurma creates common spell editions in three steps:

- Preprocessing
- Alignment
- Vulgatization

Here is that process:
### Preprocessing

### Alignment

### Vulgatization
